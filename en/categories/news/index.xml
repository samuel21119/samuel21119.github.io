      <description>We participated in the APAC HPC AI contest in the second half of 2021. This contest is held by Singapore. The goal is to run specify applications on their supercomputer. Besides, we also need to measure and compare its performance. Although this seems interesting, what we were doing is actually dealing with old environments.

Therefore, our results doesn&amp;rsquo;t perform well.</description>
